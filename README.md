# cs231n_2016_assignment
It is assignments for CS231n(Winter 2016).
These past weeks, I have been following the Stanford CS class CS231n: Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition. You can find my solutions to the assignment in this repo.

As of this writing I have yet completed the course material; completed assignments are marked [***done!***], otherwise they are as originally downloaded from the course site.

Assignment list:

Assignment #1
Q1: k-Nearest Neighbor classifier (20 points) [***done!***]
Q2: Training a Support Vector Machine (25 points) [***done!***]
Q3: Implement a Softmax classifier (20 points) [***done!***]
Q4: Two-Layer Neural Network (25 points) [***done!***]
Q5: Higher Level Representations: Image Features (10 points) [***done!***]

Assignment #2
Q1: Fully-connected Neural Network (30 points) [***done!***]
Q2: Batch Normalization (30 points) [***done!***]
Q3: Dropout (10 points) [***done!***]
Q4: ConvNet on CIFAR-10 (30 points) 

Assignment #3
Q1: Image Captioning with Vanilla RNNs (40 points)
Q2: Image Captioning with LSTMs (35 points)
Q3: Image Gradients: Saliency maps and Fooling Images (10 points)
Q4: Image Generation: Classes, Inversion, DeepDream (15 points)

I really want to thank to everyone from the CS231 Stanford class who do a fantastic work to share the knowledge to the whole word.
